- Why do we convert a linear program to standard form in simplex
	- The fundamental theorem of Linear Programming only works when the linear program is in standard form
- Is NP problems decision problems
	- Yes
- Isn't the Travelling Salesman Problem, $p \notin NP$
	- Find the _shortest path_ is not in $NP$, but find a path under $x$ _is_ in $NP$!
- What is cycling
	- Suppose we have some Dictionary $D_0$, and we pivot some number of times to get Dictionary $D_k$, then it's a cycle if $D_k$ has already occured: $D_0 \rightarrow D_1 \cdots D_k : D_k \in [D_0, D_{k-1}]$
- Why do we do dual linear programming, instead of just using simplex
	- Certificate - we can verify that our implemented algorithm is correct
- 2 phase simplex, what and why
- Ellipsoid as a replacement for Simplex
- Is $LPP \in P$?
